Cofactor-Mediated Conformational Dynamics Promote Product Release From Escherichia coli Dihydrofolate Reductase via an Allosteric Pathway
The human dihydrofolate reductase is relatively less stable than its E.coli counterpart.
The orthologous inter-species replacements caused a marked drop (in the range 10-90%) in bacterial growth rate despite the fact that most orthologous DHFRs are as stable as E.coli DHFR at 37 degrees C and are more catalytically active than E. coli DHFR.

AtHsfA2 has role in linking heat shock with oxidative stress signals in Arabidopsis
The results of this study indicate that HsfA2 is a key regulator in the induction of the defence system under several types of environmental stress.

Further analysis revealed that the steady state level of HYL1 protein in plants under osmotic stress is dependent on the SnRK2 kinases. Additionally, our results suggest that the SnRK2 kinases physically associate with the miRNA processing components SE and HYL1 and can phosphorylate these proteins in vitro.
direct interaction with SE is required for post-transcriptional inhibition of miRNA accumulation by CHR2 but not for its transcriptional activity
Arabidopsis SE associated with more than 1000, mainly intronless, genes in a transcription-dependent manner.

The competence of stomatal guard cells in V. faba to synthesize abscisic acid, using NCED3 and AAO3 from A. thaliana, is reported.
AAO3 is overexpressed in ataf1 plants compared to wild-type plants following inoculation with Bgh.
In addition to their aldehyde oxidation activity, AAO1 and AAO3 were found to exhibit NADH oxidase activity, which likewise is associated with the production of superoxide anions.
NAP promotes chlorophyll degradation by enhancing transcription of AAO3, which leads to increased levels of the senescence-inducing hormone ABA.
AtPAP12 and AtPAP26 facilitate Pi scavenging from soil-localized organophosphates during nutritional Pi deprivation.
An Arabidopsis thaliana purple acid phosphatase atpap26/atpap12 T-DNA double insertion mutant impaired growth and produced >60 and >30% decreases in root secretory APase activity and rosette total inorganic phosphorus concentration, respectively.
AtPAP12 and AtPAP26 are two major intracellular and secreted acid phosphatases (APases) in Arabidopsis while AtPAP10 is mainly a secreted APase.
LHW is nuclear-localized and is expressed in the root meristems, where we hypothesize it acts independently of other known root-patterning genes to promote the production of stele cells. 
LHW functions as a key regulator to initiate vascular cell differentiation in association with auxin regulation.
Data suggest that CLV3, CLE19 and CLE40 peptides represent the major active domain of the CLE proteins, which interact with an unknown cell identity-maintaining CLAVATA2 receptor complex in roots, leading to consumption of the root meristem.
study provides evidence that CLV3 signaling in meristems mediates both cell fate specification and growth control through inhibition of cell division rate, as well as that the processes can be temporally uncoupled
Increased CLV3 signaling restricts meristem growth and promotes allocation of peripheral meristem cells into organ primordia.
The CLV3/ESR (CLE) motif is the functional region of the CLV3 protein and it acts independently of the adjacent sequences.
structure of a modified peptide (MCLV3), derived from a conserved motif in the CLV3 sequence; synthetic MCLV3 induced shoot & root meristem consumption as cells differentiated into other organs; results suggest the functional peptide of CLV3 is MCLV3
biochemical evidence shows that the CLV3 peptide directly binds the CLV1 ectodomain with a dissociation constant of 17.5 nM; results provide direct evidence that CLV3 and CLV1 function as a ligand-receptor pair involved in stem cell maintenance
the novel receptor kinase CORYNE (CRN) and CLV2 act together, and in parallel with CLV1, to perceive the CLV3 signal
The terminal residues of MCLV3 play critical roles in exerting its activity and are important for specific binding to the receptor, CLV1.
Early development of the flower primordium has been studied in Arabidopsis thaliana clavata3-2 (clv3-2) plants with the aid of sequential in vivo replicas and longitudinal microtome sections.
Data show that CRN, rather than CLV1 and CLV2, was able to form homodimers without CLV3 stimulation.
In vitro peptide assay also showed that removal of the cysteine pairs did not affect the perception of CLV3 peptides in roots
These observations suggest that RPK2 is an essential component of an independent third pathway for CLV3 signalling
Data show that CLV3 protein CLE processing activity the in vitro cleavage occurs at Arg70, exactly matching in vivo maturation.
Downregulation of plasma membrane-localized CLV1 by its CLV3 ligand can account for the buffering of CLV3 signaling in the maintenance of stem cell pools in plants.
CLAVATA3 peptide (CLV3p), expressed and secreted from stem cells and functioning as a key regulator of stem-cell homeostasis in the shoot apical meristem, can trigger immune signalling and pathogen resistance via the flagellin receptor kinase FLS2
Data show that the CLAVATA 3 (CLV3) gene, a stem cell marker in shoot apical meristem (SAM), was expressed in expanded regions surrounding the SAM of nsn1 plants.
These studies established a complete contribution map of individual residues in the peptide-coding region of CLV3 for its function in shoot apical meristem.
Exogenous CLV3 does not trigger FLS2-dependent immune responses.
The spatial expression of the two components (WUS and CLV3) of a regulatory network maintaining shoot meristem (SM)stem cells resembles that seen in a vegetative shoot apical meristem, suggesting the rapid initiation and establishment of the new SMs.
The arabinose chain length of CLV3 is important for its biological activity.
These results suggest that 5-amino acid residues flanking the N-terminus of CLV3 peptide are required for proper cleavages and optimal function in stem cell regulation.
HECATE1 (HEC1) is a target of WUS and that it contributes to SAM function by promoting stem cell proliferation, while antagonizing niche cell activity. HEC1 represses the stem cell regulators WUS and CLAVATA3 (CLV3)
Gene NANA regulates cell proliferation in Arabidopsis thaliana shoot apical meristem without interaction with CLV3.
PLANT U-BOX 4 (PUB4), is a key regulatory component of root meristem maintenance that functions downstream of an exogenous synthetic CLV3 peptide.
One of the targets of miR172, APETALA2 (AP2), antagonizes CLV signalling. The ap2-2 mutation strongly suppresses sqn meristem phenotypes, indicating that the effect of SQN on stem cell dynamics is largely, but not fully, mediated by the miR172/AP2 tandem.
CLV3 ligand/CLV1 receptor system initiates a signaling cascade that elevates cytosolic Ca(2+). This cytosolic secondary messenger is involved in the signal transduction cascade linking CLV3/CLV1 to control of gene expression and stem cell fate in the shoot apical meristem (SAM).
In shoot apical meristem, FHY3 directly represses CLV3, which consequently regulates WUS to maintain the stem cell pool.
structures provide insights about the ligand perception and specific interactions between the CLE peptides and their cognate receptors
Dynamic expression reveals a two-step patterning of WUS and CLV3 during axillary shoot meristem formation in Arabidopsis
CLV signaling involves the secretion of the CLV3 peptide and its perception by a number of Leucine-Rich-Repeat (LRR) receptors, including the receptor-like kinase CLV1 and the receptor-like protein CLV2 coupled with the CORYNE (CRN) pseudokinase. CLV2, and its maize ortholog FASCIATED EAR2 (FEA2) appear to function in signaling by CLV3 and several related CLV3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptide ligands
The role of CLV3 signal transduction in regulating stem cell fate.
Auxin signaling in stem cells is mediated, at least in part, by AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 5/MONOPTEROS (ARF5/MP), which directly represses the transcription of DORNROSCHEN/ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION 1 (DRN/ESR1). DRN expressed in stem cells positively regulates CLAVATA3 (CLV3) expression and has important meristematic functions.
The hypothesis explains how the WUSCHEL gene product, synthesized basally in the meristem, induces CLAVATA3-expressing stem cells in the meristem apex but, paradoxically, not in the basal domain where WUSCHEL itself is expressed. The answer involves the activity of the small family of HAIRY MERISTEM genes, which prevent the activation of CLAVATA3 and which are expressed basally in the shoot meristem.

We propose a new model for iron uptake in Arabidopsis where FRO2 and IRT1 are differentially regulated by FIT1 which encodes a putative transcription factor that regulates iron uptake responses in Arabidopsis thaliana 
AtbHLH29 encods a bHLH protein, which is a functional ortholog of the tomato FER gene which are proposed as transcriptional factors functioning in iron deficiency responses and iron uptake. 
A proposed common name for At2g28160 in Arabidopsis, namely FIT=FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, is discussed.
ferric-chelate reductase FRO2 and ferrous-transporter IRT1 are the targets of the three transcription factors and the transcription of FRO2 and IRT1 is directly regulated by a complex of FIT/AtbHLH38 or FIT/AtbHLH39.
FIT is post-translationally regulated by iron deficiency, leading to a decrease in FIT protein stability mediated by proteasome-dependent degradation.
EIN3/EIL1 physically interact with FIT, are required for full FIT accumulation, and contribute to full FIT downstream target gene expression.

The authors provide evidence that subgroup transcription factor bHLH039 transcription factor is involved in FIT transcriptional regulation.
Plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) negatively affects iron acquisition by repressing the expression of iron uptake regulatory gene FIT and promoting its protein degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. The subgroup IVa bHLH transcription factors (bHLH18, bHLH19, bHLH20, and bHLH25) are FIT interactors that function in JA-mediated FIT protein degradation.
CSD2 expression is fine-tuned by miR398-directed mRNA cleavage.
Results show that CSD1, but not CSD2, mRNA levels were negatively correlated with miR398 levels during ozone, salinity and biotic stress.
miR398 links expression of the three major chloroplast copper proteins, plastocyanin, CCS1 and Csd2, to copper availability.
Data indicate that transgenic plants expressing miR398-resistant forms of CSD1, CSD2 and CCS under the control of their native promoters are more sensitive to heat stress.
Data indicate that in the MKK5-RNAi (RNA interference) lines, the induction of CSD1 and CSD2 as well as the activation of MKK5 activity were completely arrested.
downregulation of CSD2 by the heat-inducible miR398 is required for thermotolerance in Arabidopsis.
In a series of grafting experiments using spl7 mutant and wild-type (WT) plants, expression of Cu-responsive microRNAs and the resulting suppression of CSD1 and CSD2 mRNAs were observed in leaves only when the aerial part was from WT plants, in which a low level of SPL7 was transcribed also in the vascular tissues.

show that the double-stranded RNA binding proteins DRB2 and DRB4 are required for proper accumulation of p4-siRNAs.
Examination of different single and multiple drb mutants revealed a clear association between the loss of DRB2 activity and altered accumulation for both the elevated and reduced miRNA classes.
Unlike DRB2, DRB3 and DRB5 are not involved in the double stranded RNA processing stages of the microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway, but are required to mediate RNA silencing of target genes of DRB2-associated miRNAs.
DRB2 is part of a repressive epigenetic regulator complex involved in a negative feedback loop, adjusting epigenetic state to transcription level at transposable element loci.
DRB2-associated translational inhibition appears to be less ubiquitous and specifically aimed toward responses against abiotic or biotic stimuli.
Arabidopsis SAND protein is not required for early-to-late endosomal maturation, although its role in mediating Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion is conserved. Instead, it is essential for the subsequent fusion of multivesicular bodies with the vacuole.

Results suggest that AtRAD51B gene product is involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks via homologous recombination. 
The roles of RAD51B and XRCC2 in recombination are thus not limited to mitotic cells.
The genome stability of the Arabidopsis thaliana mutants deficient in ATM (communication between DNA strand break recognition and the repair machinery), KU80 (deficient in NHEJ) and RAD51B (deficient in HR repair) genes, was investigated.
Notwithstanding their clearly established importance for RAD51-dependent homologous recombination, XRCC2, RAD51B and RAD51D thus also participate in Single-Strand Annealing recombination.
Specific expression of PRS and WOX1 in a domain between the adaxial and abaxial domains is important for lateral-specific blade outgrowth and margin-specific cell fate.

Alb3 has a role in insertion of a subset of the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins, while Alb4 is required for proper chloroplast biogenesis
The activation of TFL1 expression by PPF1 defines an important pathway possibly essential for the negative regulation of plant senescence in transgenic Arabidopsis. 
alb3 mutants generally exhibit defects in the biogenesis of light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins and other thylakoidal membrane proteins that are more severe than in the cpftsY mutants.
Alb3 is adapted for the chloroplast-specific Alb3-cpSRP43 interaction in post-translational targeting by extending the spectrum of chromodomain interactions.
Propose that cpSRP43 is crucial for the binding of LHCP-loaded cpSRP and cpFtsY to Alb3. In addition, data suggest that a direct interaction between Alb3 and LHCP contributes to the formation of this complex.
cpSRP43 inserts into a dimeric Alb3 translocation pore during cpSRP-dependent delivery of light-harvesting chlorophyll a,b-binding proteins

ALB3 contributes to the process of protein insertion into the thylakoids via the ALB3-chloroplast signal recognition particle pathway.
study has revealed a unique regulatory circuit of direct ubiquitination and turnover of FLS2 by BAK1-mediated phosphorylation and recruitment of specific E3 ligases (PUB12,PUB13) for attenuation of immune signaling
The resemblance between PUB13ARM transgenic plants and the pub12pub13 mutant provides genetic evidence that ectopic expression of the PUB ARM domain serves as an alternative approach to dissect the overlapping functions of closely related PUB genes.
ABI1 (ABA-INSENSITIVE 1) can interact with the U-box E3 ligases PUB12 and PUB13, but is ubiquitinated only when it interacts with ABA receptors in an in vitro assay.

central role of the CYP707A2 gene in the nitrate-mediated control of Abscisic acid levels during seed development and germination of arabidopsis thaliana.
Glucose-induced delay in seed germination and seedling development is directly related to the suppression of ABA catabolism through the repression of the CYP707A2 expression.
Genetic analysis shows that NLP8-mediated promotion of seed germination by nitrate requires CYP707A2.

In Arabidopsis, D53-like SMXLs act with TPR2 to repress transcription and so allow lateral bud outgrowth but that strigolactone-induced degradation of D53-like proteins activates transcription to inhibit outgrowth. 
Data suggests that SMAX1 and SMXL6,7,8 repress karrikin and strigolactone signaling, respectively, and that all MAX2-dependent growth effects are mediated by degradation of SMAX1/SMXL proteins.
SMXL7 contains a well-conserved EAR (ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR Amphiphilic Repression) motif, which contributes to, but is not essential for, SMXL7 functionality. Intriguingly, different developmental processes show differential sensitivity to the loss of the EAR motif, raising the possibility that there may be several distinct mechanisms at play downstream of SMXL7.

PKS5-mediated phosphorylation of ABI5 at Ser-42 is critical for the abscissic acid regulation of seed germination and gene expression in Arabidopsis.
SOS2-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE5 (PKS5) can negatively regulate the Salt-Overly-Sensitive signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. PKS5 can interact with and phosphorylate SOS2 at Ser294, promote the interaction between SOS2 and 14-3-3 proteins, and repress SOS2 activity. However, salt stress promotes an interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and PKS5, repressing its kinase activity and releasing inhibition of SOS2.

Total repression of embryogenic potential was observed in double (lec1 lec2, lec1 fus3, lec2 fus3) and triple (fus3 lec1 lec2) mutants.
Results show that Significant differences in histone modifications at the phas promoter were mediated by FUS3 and PvALF, suggesting that they function through different epigenetic mechanisms.
FUS3 function is restricted to the acquisition of embryo-dependent seed dormancy, the determination of cotyledonary cell identity, and the synthesis and accumulation of storage compounds.
The C-terminal domain is required for normal FUS3 function and sensitivity to abscisic acid and gibberellic acid, and negatively regulates mRNA and protein levels.
The genes positively controlled by FUS3 are not confined to previously known seed maturation-related genes and include those involved in the production of secondary metabolites and those involved in primary metabolism.
FUS3 is phosphorylated by AKIN10. AKIN10 overexpression delays FUS3 degradation. AKIN10 and FUS3 function interactively to promote seed maturation, dormancy and inhibit developmental phase transitions.
FUS3 contributes to the delay of seed germination at high temperature.
Activation of FUS3 after germination dampens the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis and response to the plant hormone ethylene, whereas a loss-of-function fus3 mutant shows many phenotypes consistent with increased ethylene signaling.

LOV1 domain of Phot1 and Phot2 forms a dimer through face-to-face association of beta-scaffolds in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.
The recombinant LOV1 domains of phototropin 1 and phototropin 2 have been crystallized; the crystal of the LOV1 domain of phototropin 1 belongs to orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and diffracts X-rays to a resolution of 2.1 angstroms.
Phot1 is more sensitive to light stimuli than phot2. The N-terminal moiety of phot1 mainly determines the sensitivity of the response.
Data show that the dissociation of the linker region from the LOV2 domain is a key step for the conformation change of the phot1LOV2-linker to induce biological activity, and suggest that the phototropins could have a role as a temperature sensors.
Localization of phot1 in Arabidopsis is mediated by phytochrome A.
phot1-LOV2 is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium and phot2-LOV2 exists as a monomer in the dark
Phototropism of inflorescence stems and leaf petioles is also controlled by phototropins. phot1 works as a major photoreceptor under low and high light conditions.
Coexpression of active and inactive forms of phot1 demonstrates that autophosphorylation can occur intermolecularly, independent of LOV1, via light-dependent receptor dimerization in vivo.
phot1 is a blue-light receptor kinases controlling a range of responses that optimize the photosynthetic efficiency of Arabidosis.
Findings indicate that while phot1-5/phot2-1 plants also responded to changes in light intensity, the resulting pattern of chloroplast distribution was quite different from that in WT.
The inhibition by PhyB is not exclusive to either of the phot1 or phot2 signalling pathways.
The fluence-response kinetics and time course were similar to the phototropin1 mediated response observed following a blue pulse.
After 5 minutes of exposure to blue light, there were significant differences in expression patterns in phot1 and phot2 mutants from that of the chup1 mutant.
Phosphorylation of ABCB19 by phot1 inhibits its efflux activity, thereby increasing auxin levels in and above the hypocotyl apex.
No reorganization of chloropast-actin filaments was seen in phot2 or phot1phot2 mutants lacking phot2, and jac1 mutants, lacking the accumulation response, showed no avoidance movements under the whole-cell irradiation condition.
The plasma membrane-associated phototropic receptor phot1 is ubiquitinated in response to blue light activation. Ubiquitination of phot1 is dependent upon both the phot1-interacting proteins NPH3 and CUL3.
photoregulation of the kinase in phototropin1 (phot1)
Leaf epidermal peels of Arabidopsis mutants lacking phototropins 1 and 2 exposed to a background of red light show severely impaired stomatal opening responses to blue light.

Phytochrome Kinase Substrate 4 (PKS4), a known element of phot1 signalling, is a substrate of phot1 kinase activity in vitro and is phosphorylated in a phot1-dependent manner in vivo.
PHOT1 functions in mediating chloroplast accumulation. PHOT1 LOV2 domain is essential to maintain developing primary leaves in a horizontal position under white light from above.
Data indicate that the green light (GL) opposition of red light (RL) responses persists in phyA, phyB, cry1cry2 and phot2 mutants, and the response requires phot1 and NPH3.
Phot1 and Phot2 promote leaf flattening by suppressing the leaf-curling activity of phyB.
the photosensitivity of kinase activation in phot involves the lifetime of S390 in LOV2, suggesting that the lifetime is one of the key factors for the different photosensitivities observed for phot1 and phot2
phototropin 1 localizes on the chloroplast outer membrane
Phot1 mediates the high-intensity blue light-induced cytosolic calcium increases in hypocotyls.
phototropic bending of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings requires phot1 in the upper hypocotyl, below the cotyledonary node, to perceive the phototropic stimulus and induce a signaling cascade that rapidly spreads to all cell layers in the hypocotyl.
A. thaliana phototropin 1 LOV2 domain is a dimer in which two alpha helices adopt a scissor-like orientation at the dimer interface and form a short alpha-helical coiled coil.
PHOT1 plays a role(s) in elongation of lateral roots through the control of an auxin-related signalling pathway.
The phot1-mediated adjustment of phytochrome-regulated photomorphogenic events is most robust in dim blue light conditions and is likely modulated by auxin transport through its transporters.
Truncation of the A'alpha-helix and AA substitutions at Glu474 and Lys475 in the gap between the A'alpha and the Abeta strand of LOV2 to Ala impaired the BL-induced activation of the STK, but did not affect S390 formation.
After cold treatment, in darkness, the expression of phototropin1 is down-regulated, while phototropin2 levels are up-regulated. The motile system of chloroplasts in Arabidopsis is more sensitive to blue light at low temperature, similar to other species.
phot1 and phot2 phosphorylate BLUE LIGHT SIGNALING1 (BLUS1) kinase as a common substrate in stomatal opening. phot1 phosphorylates BLUS1 more efficiently. The phosphorylation status of BLUS1 is a key determinant of physiological response.
lysine 475, a functionally important residue, in the N-terminal region of LOV2 plays a critical role in transmitting the structural changes in LOV2 to the kinase domain. The interface between the domains is critical for signaling, suitably changing the structure to activate the kinase in response to conformational changes in the adjoining LOV2.
The spatial targeting approach therefore excludes the hypocotyl apex as the site for light perception for phototropism and shows that phot1-mediated NPH3 de-phosphorylation is tissue autonomous and occurs more prominently in the basal hypocotyl.
Data suggest that Arabidopsis can adapt to elevated phosphorylation status of phototropin-1 R472H mutant in part by reducing its stability, whereas activity of the mutant under high-light conditions can be attributed to additional increases in LOV2-mediated photoreceptor autophosphorylation.
Data suggest that Arabidopsis can adapt to elevated phosphorylation status of phototropin-1 R472H mutant in part by reducing its stability, whereas activity of the mutant under high-light conditions can be attributed to additional increases in LOV2-mediated photoreceptor autophosphorylation.

Data identify three factors that regulate the lipid interaction of Lti30 in vitro: (1) a pH dependent His on/off switch, (2) phosphorylation by protein kinase C, and (3) reversal of membrane binding by proteolytic digest.

A screen for mutations that enhance ROP1-overexpression-induced depolarization of pollen-tube growth identified REN1 (ROP1 enhancer 1), whose null mutations turn elongated pollen tubes into bulbous cells.
RIP1 is involved in the positive feedback regulation of ROP1 localization to the plasma membrane, leading to the establishment of a polar site for pollen germination and pollen tube growth.
Correct positioning of the ROP patch depends on the cell length, low diffusion of active ROP, a gradient in auxin concentration, and ROP levels.

Ethylene overproduction partially restores auxin responsiveness to auxin-resistant mutants of ETO1.
In Arabidopsis, ETO1 encodes a negative regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, and mutation of ETO1 causes Arabidopsis seedlings to overproduce ethylene.
The level of ETHYLENE-OVERPRODUCER1 (ETO1)/ETO1-LIKE (EOLs) in vivo plays a role in mediating ACS (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase) protein turnover, with increased levels leading to a decrease in ACS protein levels.

Treatment of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings with light rapidly increases the stability of ACS5 protein and destabilizes the ETO1/EOLs proteins.

Data indicate that SEEDSTICK (STK) and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) dimers can induce loop formation in the VERDANDI (VDD) promoter by binding to two nearby CC(A/T)6GG (CArG) boxes essential for promoter activity.
STK might recruit or regulate histone modifying factors to control their activity in Arabidopsis.
studies reveal a molecular network controlled by STK that regulates cell wall properties of the seed coat, demonstrating that developmental regulators controlling organ identity also coordinate specific aspects of cell wall characteristics.

Findings suggests a role for DET1 in a ubiquitination pathway and identify a substrate for DET1-regulated protein turn-over.
Arabidopsis cullin 4 is shown to assemble with DDB1, RBX1, DET1 and DDB2 in vitro and in planta.
DDB1A-dependent phenotypes indicate a competition between DDB2- and DET1-containing complexes for available DDB1A, while, for DDB1A-independent phenotypes, DDB1B is able to fulfill this role.
DDB1A-3HA overexpression affected phenotypes in a variety of DET1 backgrounds, reduced epitope-tagged DET1 levels, and, correlatively, in general dampened the rescue of det1 mutants by the DET1-DDB1A complex.
Results show that SPA1 and DET1 act together to control photomorphogenesis throughout plant development.
LHY ubiquitination by SINAT5 was inhibited by DET1.
Altogether, these data suggest that DET1, CUL4 and DDB2 cooperate during the excision repair process.
results reveal DET1 as a core transcriptional repression factor important for clock progression
The det1 acts epistatically to uvh6 with respect to de-etiolation, chlorophyll level, UV tolerance, and heat-induced growth inhibition. (DET1 protein)
DDB1A and DDB1B contribute to DET1 regulation of adult plant growth.
PEX2 RING domain overexpression in det1 also partially suppresses the det1 phenotype.
Genomic analysis also revealed that DET1 may modulate the expression of light-regulated genes to mediate photomorphogenesis partially through phytochrome-interacting factors.
Light and COP1 regulate level of overexpressed DET1 protein
DET1 acts upstream of both HFR1 and PIF1 to predominantly repress seed germination. DET1 predominantly represses seed germination in the dark.
DET1 is a strong repressor of flowering and has a pivotal role in maintaining photoperiod sensitivity in the regulation of flowering time.
Germination in det1 mutants is sensitive to ABA. Double mutant analysis indicates that det1 abscisic acid sensitive germination requires HY5 and ABI5.
These findings reveal a mechanistic framework in which DET1/COP1 and HY5 regulatory modules act independently to regulate growth through the environmental signal integrator PIF4.
DET1-DDB1-Associated-1 (DDA1) protein interacts with SGF11 in vivo, linking the DET1 complex to light-dependent ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation of the deubiquitination module.

controls Na(+) homeostasis and through this function regulates K(+) nutrient status
AtHKT1 selectively unloads sodium directly from xylem vessels to xylem parenchyma cells.
SOS3 and AtHKT1 are major determinants of salinity resistance such that sos3 more strongly causes Na+ overaccumulation in roots, whereas athkt1 causes an increase in Na+ levels in the xylem sap and shoots and a concomitant Na+ reduction in roots.
Using DNA microarray-based genotyping, identified AtHKT1 as the casual locus driving the natural variation in shoot Na(+) accumulation we observed in Ts-1 and Tsu-1
AtHKT1;1 contributes to the control of both root accumulation of Na(+) and retrieval of Na(+) from the xylem, but is not involved in root influx or recirculation in the phloem.
Results demonstrate that tissue-specific regulation of HKT1 is critical for managing Na(+) homeostasis in salt-stressed plants, as well as underscore the breadth and sophistication of plant-microbe interactions
Plants constitutively expressing HKT1;1 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter accumulated high shoot Na+ and grew poorly.
Studies demonstrated that a class of xylem-parenchyma-expressed Na(+)-permeable plant HKT transporters represent a primary mechanism mediating salt tolerance and Na(+) exclusion from leaves.
Overexpress AtHKT1 in the cortex and epidermis upregulated the native AtHKT1.
Cis-regulatory expression level polymorphisms at the AtHKT1;1 locus, encoding a known sodium (Na(+)) transporter, was identified as being a major factor controlling natural variation in leaf Na(+) accumulation capacity in the A. thaliana population.

HKT1;1 loss induced decrease and increase in transcripts of AtSKOR and AtHAK5, respectively.
Analysis of the xanthophyll binding LHC proteins showed that the Lhcb5 photosystem II subunit (also called CP26) undergoes a change in its pI upon binding of zeaxanthin.
location of the neoxanthin binding site in CP26 and CP29 was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis.
Photosynthesis was affected in plants lacking CP24 but not in plants lacking CP26: CP24 mutant had decreased electron transport rates, lower DeltapH gradient across the grana membranes, reduced capacity for nonphotochemical quenching, and limited growth
Occupancy and functional architecture of the pigment binding sites of photosystem II antenna complex Lhcb5.

SMB, BRN1, and BRN2, which are members of the Class IIB NAC transcription factor family, act redundantly to drive cellular differentiation and promote maturation of the root cap and the cell wall separations needed to produce a functional root cap. 
NIP5;1 functions as a boric acid channel for Boron uptake and is crucial for plant growth under Boron limitation in Arabidopsis.
Nodulin26-like Intrinsic Proteins (NIPs) AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1 from A. thaliana, OsNIP2;1 and OsNIP3;2 from O. sativa, and LjNIP5;1 and LjNIP6;1 from Lotus japonicus are bi-directional As(III) channels.
Enhanced expression of NIP5;1 resulted in improved root elongation under boron-limiting conditions.
The present study of BOR1 and NIP5;1 demonstrates the importance of selective endocytic trafficking in polar localization and degradation of plant nutrient transporters for radial transport and homeostasis of plant mineral nutrients.
The residue at the H5 helix position of the aromatic/arginine filter of both OsLsi1 and AtNIP5;1 plays a key role in the permeability to silicon and boron, but there is a relatively low selectivity for arsenite.
The 5' UTR controls boron-dependent NIP5;1 mRNA degradation and that NIP5;1 mRNA degradation is important for plant acclimation to high-boron conditions.
Rough mapping and whole-genome sequencing identified the mutant with altered localization of NIP5;1 as an allele of UDP-glucose 4-epimerase 4.
The direct root uptake of urea was increased under boron deficiency, in both the high and low affinity range. This activity was entirely mediated by the NIP5;1 channel.
The results demonstrate that the polar localization of NIP5;1 is maintained by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, is dependent on phosphorylation in the TPG repeat, and is necessary for the efficient transport of boron in roots.
Data indicate that At4g10500 was found to encode a functional salicylic acid 3-hydroxylase (S3H).

may play a role in mitochondrial DNA recombination
WRKY41 is an important regulator of ABI3 expression, and hence of seed dormancy.
SPA2 protein can self-associate or interact with each other, forming stable heterogeneous group of SPA-COP1 complexes regardless of light conditions but exhibit distinct expression profiles in different tissues and light conditions.
SPA1 and SPA2 proteins are rapidly de-stabilized upon light exposure. SPA2 protein is inherently incapable of repressing photomorphogenesis in light-grown seedlings.
COP1/SPA activity, via LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FR LIGHT1, is required for shade-induced modulation of the auxin biosynthesis pathway and thereby enhances cell elongation in low red:far red.
propose that light perceived by phytochromes causes a switch in the ubiquitination activity of COP1/SPA2 from ubiquitinating downstream substrates to ubiquitinating SPA2, which subsequently causes a repression of COP1/SPA2 function
The N-terminal kinase-like domain is primarily responsible for the respective light-responsiveness of SPA1 and SPA2.
SPA proteins have a dual role: (1) they are required for light-responsiveness of COP1 subcellular localization, and (2) they promote COP1 activity in darkness in a fashion that is independent of the nuclear import/nuclear retention of COP1.
Data show that small interfering RNAs and larger RNA fragments corresponding miRNA target genes accumulate in wild-type plants but not in ago1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mutants rdr2 and rdr6, or the Dicer-like mutants dcl1 and dcl3.
RDR2 is required for reception of long-distance mRNA silencing.
RDR2 plays a significant role in regulating the expression of not only transposons, but also of genes.
Data show that SHH1(AT1G15215), RDR2, CLASSY1, and RDM4 were co-purified with NRPD1(At1g63020), the largest subunit of Pol-IV.
The data suggest a mechanism whereby IBM1 regulates a series of protein-coding genes including RDR2 through the RdDM-dependent control of siRNA biogenesis.
Results suggest that the physical and mechanistic coupling of Pol IV and RDR2 results in the channeled synthesis of double-stranded precursors for siRNA biogenesis.
These findings begin to reveal features of Pol IV/RDR2-mediated transcription at the heart of genome stability in plants.
JMJ24 binds to RDR2 and is required for the basal level transcription of silenced loci in Arabidopsis.

RTNLB1 and RTNLB2 modulate FLS2 immune activity through a mechanism that involves the control of the anterograde transport of FLS2.
SGT1b antagonizes RAR1 to negatively regulate R protein accumulation before infection, and SGT1b has a RAR1-independent function that regulates programmed cell death during infection 
Biochemical reconstitution experiments suggest that RAR1 may function to enhance the SGT1-HSP90 interaction by promoting ternary complex formation.
Genetic analysis revealed that ssi4-induced H(2)O(2) accumulation and spontaneous cell death require RAR1, whereas ssi4-mediated stunting is dependent on SGT1b.
Data show that intact C-terminal SGT1-specific (SGS) domain that is required for all known SGT1b functions in immunity and development is needed for HSC70 interaction and for the nuclear accumulation of SGT1b.
SGT1b has a role in disease resistance against Fusarium culmorum.
The induction of defence responses and disease resistance to X. campestris pv. campestris strain 8004 requires NDR1 , RAR1 and SGT1b, suggesting that effector-triggered immunity plays a large role in resistance to this strain.
This study showed that increased temperature promotes rapid accumulation of the TIR1 auxin co-receptor, an effect that is dependent on the molecular chaperone HSP90, and that HSP90 and SGT1 integrate temperature and auxin signaling.

Arabidopsis thaliana serine racemase (AtSR) gene is expressed in elongating and developing cells without regulation of biotic and abiotic stresses in plants transformed by AtSR promoter-beta-glucuronidase reporter gene.
Data suggest that HsfB1 and HsfB2b may be involved in complex regulatory networks, which are linked to other stress responses and signaling processes.
These data indicate that HsfB1 and HsfB2b suppress the general heat shock response under non-heat-stress conditions and in the attenuating period.
The constitutive expression of HsfB2b leads to severely reduced levels of the PRR7 transcript and late flowering and elongated hypocotyls.

PLDgammas play a role in membrane lipid modulation under Al stress and that high activities of PLDgammas negatively modulate plant tolerance to Al
GBF1 is a transcriptional repressor of the AtCathB3 gene and affects germination kinetics of A. thaliana seeds. As AtCathB3 is also expressed during post-germination in cotyledons, a role for the AtCathB3-like protease in reserve mobilization is inferred.
Recombinant and native AtCathB3 had enzymatic activity against the synthetic caspase-3 substrate DEVD (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp) and were inhibited by synthetic caspase-3 inhibitors. cathepsin B does regulate PCD in both animal and plant cells suggesting that this protease may be part of an ancestral PCD pathway pre-existing the plant/animal divergence. 
AtCathB2 and AtCathB3 are two closely related PLCPs which display subtle differences in their hydrolytic properties and substrate specificities. Both enzymes can act as endopeptidases and carboxydipeptidases.

Chlorophyll (Chl) retention in the nye1 nye2 double-mutant caused severe photo-damage to maturing seeds. Upon prolonged light exposure, green seeds of nye1 nye2 gradually bleached out and eventually lost their germination capacity. our data suggest that efficient NYEs-mediated Chl degradation is critical for detoxification during seed maturation.
the atypical E2F transcription factor E2Fe/DEL1 controls the expression of the CDH1/FZR orthologous CCS52A2 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana
CCS52A2 acts directly in the distal region of the root meristem to control identity of the quiescent center (QC) cells and stem cell maintenance.
Studies indicate that the APC is composed of at least 11 subunits and associates with additional regulatory activators CDC20/CCS52 during mitosis and interphase cycles.
The CCS52A2 gene is a mediator that functions together with meristematic genes to regulate meristem organization.
Findings support both complementary and dose-dependent actions for the Arabidopsis CCS52A isoforms in plant development and demonstrate that elevated ectopic CCS52A expression positively correlates with organ size, opening a route to higher biomass production. 
A ccs52A2 mutation did not affect the level or pattern of cyclin B1;1 expression, indicating that CCS52A2 does not mediate the effect of auxin on cyclin B1;1.
The data illustrate cooperative activity of the APC/C(CCS52A1) and APC/C(CCS52A2) complexes during root and trichome development, but functional interdependency during leaf development. Furthermore, we found APC/C(CCS52A1) activity to control CCS52A2 expression. We conclude that interdependency of CCS52A-controlled APC/C activity is controlled in a tissue-specific manner.
In a genetic screen for suppressors of triploid seed abortion, we have identified the paternally expressed imprinted gene ADMETOS (ADM). Here, we present evidence that increased dosage of ADM causes triploid seed arrest.

Data show that ClpS1 (AT1G68660) interacts with plastid ClpC1 (AT5G50920), ClpC2 (AT3G48870), but not with ClpT1 (AT4G25370) or ClpT2 (AT4G12060).
In vivo and in vitro assays showed that ClpT1 and ClpT2 can independently interact with the single ClpP ring and ClpPR core, but not with the single ClpR ring.
Arabidopsis mitochondrial COG0354 represents an ancient, folate-dependent protein family involved in the metabolism of Fe/S cluster containing enzymes
Arabidopsis HOP3, whose function was not studied before, interacts in vivo with cytosolic HSP90 and HSP70, and, unexpectedly, with binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), a HSP70 endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein.
findings open the exciting possibility that HOP3, through its role in the alleviation of ER stress, could play an important function during different developmental processes and in response to different biotic and abiotic stresses.
MYB55 was higher expressed in basal cells than in trichome and pavement cells.
findings show that azelaic acid and AZI1 (At4g12470) are components of plant systemic immunity involved in priming defenses
AZI1 might be multifunctional and associated with cold tolerance of Arabidopsis.
The lipid transfer proteins AZI1 which is required for G3P- and azelaic acid-induced Systemic acquired resistance, is essential for G3P accumulation.
AZI1 is involved in defense priming in systemic plant immunity and was down-regulated in leaves by biotic and abiotic stresses.
AZI1 overexpression in the mpk3 genetic background partially alleviates the salt-hypersensitive phenotype of this mutant, but functional MPK3 appears to be required for the full extent of AZI1-conferred robustness.
plastid targeting of AZI1 and AZI1 paralogs occurs through a mechanism that may enable/facilitate their roles in signal mobilization
AZI1 is a partially secreted protein and a likely new member of the group of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins.
The function of AZI1 in systemic acquired resistance of Arabidopsis was confirmed by investigation of the phenotypic features of wild-type Col-0, AZI1 T-DNA knockout and AZI1 overexpressing plants after infection with virulent and avirulent Pseudomonas syringae.
used natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana to study the role of zinc in regulating growth. We identify allelic variation of the systemic immunity gene AZI1 as a key for determining root growth responses to low zinc conditions

A role for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in plant defense responses was suggested initially by the upregulated expression of genes encoding NUDT7 and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase in multiple R-avr interactions.
structure-activity studies: mutation of specific residues in AtNUDT7 alters function; mutation of residues F73 & V168 disallows dimer formation & enzymatic activity; mutation of residues V69, F73, & V168 disrupts binding to regulatory 14-3-3 protein
Under oxidative stress, AtNUDX7 serves to maintain NAD(+) levels by supplying ATP via nucleotide recycling from free ADP-Rib molecules and thus regulates the defense mechanisms against oxidative DNA damage via modulation of the PAR reaction. 
AtNUDT7 protein levels are induced in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. AtNUDT7 plays an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis, particularly for maintaining NADH:NAD+ balance for normal growth and development.

This study provides evidence of a mesophyll-derived positive regulator of stomatal development, called stomagen. 
EPFL9 plays a role in controlling stomatal development.
control of stomatal density by the STOMAGEN gene
EPF1/EPF2-like proteins form an additional disulfide bond in their loop regions and show greater flexibility in these regions than EPFL9/Stomagen-like peptides.
MONOPTEROS directly binds to the STOMAGEN promoter to suppress its expression in mesophyll and inhibit stomatal development.
mutation in the leucine-rich receptor kinase ERECTA and its putative peptide ligand STOMAGEN block the effect of hydrogen peroxide on root cortex proliferation
Analysis of gain and loss of function of STOMAGEN detailed its function as a positive regulator of stomatal formation on both sides of the leaf, not only in terms of stomatal density across the leaf surface but also in terms of their stomatal index.
Stomagen (also called EPF-LIKE9) peptide, which promotes stomatal development, requires ERECTA (ER)-family receptor kinases and interferes with the inhibition of stomatal development by the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 2 (EPF2)-ER module

NYC1 expression is regulated by abscisic acid.
accumulation of NYC1 requires chlorophyll b
Chlorophyll b degradation by NYC1 is the initial reaction for the optimization of the light-harvesting capacity under high-light conditions.
3 single base pair mutations disrupted NON-YELLOW COLORING1 function, one by producing a termination codon, the second by interfering with correct intron splicing and the third by replacing a highly conserved proline with a non-equivalent serine residue.
The mRNA and protein levels of NYC1 increased after SGR overexpression in wild type plants. Mg-dechelation of chlorophyll a by SGR activates chlorophyll b degradation by inducing the expression of NYC1. This is an effective regulation of a metabolic pathway.
SPL regulates auxin homeostasis by repressing the transcription of YUC2 and YUC6 and participates in lateral organ morphogenesis.
Expressions of YUCs in the leaf respond to the adaxial-abaxial juxtaposition, and that the activities of auxin mediate leaf margin development, which subsequently promotes blade outgrowth.
In BnaA.TTG2.a.1-overexpressing Arabidopsis under salt stress, the endogenous indole-3-acetic acid content was reduced, and expression of two auxin biosynthesis genes, TRYPTOPHAN BIOSYNTHESIS 5 (TRP5) and YUCCA2 (YUC2), was downregulated.

Upregulation of the HAK5 protein in response to potassium deprivation in A. thaliana.
AtHAK5 is a root plasma membrane uptake mechanism for K(+) and Cs(+) under conditions of low K(+) availability.
AtHAK5 mediates K+ absorption at low concentration better than AtAKT1. AtHAK5 induction is repressed by NH4+.
Although having a limited capacity, AtHAK5 plays a major role for K(+) acquisition from low K(+) concentrations in the presence of salinity.
AtHAK5 is the only system mediating K+ uptake at concentrations below 0.01 mM. In the range between 0.01 and 0.05 mM K+ AtHAK5 and AtAKT1 are the only contributors to K+ acquisition.
Results suggested that RCI3 is involved in the production of ROS under potassium deprivation and that RCI3-mediated ROS production affects the regulation of AtHAK5 expression.
AtHAK5 and AKT1 are vital for plant growth and development at low K+ concentrations.
Examination of the athak5 atakt1 double mutant, revealing novel aspects of an uptake system as yet unidentified by genetic means.
HAK5 and four transcriptin factor genes DDF2, JLO, bHLH121 and TFII_A were highly up-regulated in response to both -K and salt stress.
Lack of ETO1 function leads to significant enhancement of tissue K status by an RBOHF-independent mechanism associated with elevated high-affinity K(+) TRANSPORTER5 transcript levels.
On the one hand the existence of a posttranscriptional regulation of HAK5 elicited by the low K(+) signal and on the other that HAK5 may be involved in yet-unknown functions related to NO(3)(-) and P deficiencies.
Data show that Arabidopsis Mutants lacking CBL-interacting protein kinase23 (CIPK23) are deficient in high-affinity K(+) transporter5 (HAK5)-mediated high-affinity potassium (K(+)) uptake.
ILK1 interacted with and promoted the accumulation of HAK5, a putative (H(+))/K(+) symporter that mediates a high-affinity uptake during K(+) deficiency.
results demonstrate that ARF2 plays important roles in the response to external K(+) supply in Arabidopsis and regulates HAK5 transcription accordingly.

SRA-domain proteins (SUVH9) are also essential for DRM2-mediated de novo and maintenance DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana.
SUVH2 and SUVH9 functions in RdDM and TGS are overlapping. Pol V specific transcripts were reduced in suvh2 suvh9 plants. This might indicate a role of these SUVH proteins in Pol V complex recruitment.
Our CHIP assay demonstrated that SUVH2 and SUVH9 are required for the occupancy of Pol V at RdDM loci and facilitate the production of Pol V-dependent noncoding RNAs
We demonstrate that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex components SWI3B, SWI3C, and SWI3D interact with MORC6 as well as with SUVH9 and then mediate transcriptional silencing. These results suggest that the RdDM components are involved not only in DNA methylation but also in MORC6-mediated heterochromatin condensation.

PP2A-B'gamma is a positive regulator of flowering that contributes to the repression of the major flowering repressor gene FLC in Arabidopsis.
PP2A-B'gamma physically interacts with the cytoplasmic form of aconitase and PP2A-B'gamma impacts reactive oxygen species homeostasis by controlling the abundance of specific alternative oxidase isoforms, AOX1A and AOX1D, in leaf mitochondria.
By controlling reactive oxygen species homeostasis and signaling, PP2A-B'gamma and PP2A-B'zeta may direct acclimation strategies upon environmental perturbations, hence acting as important determinants of defense responses and light acclimation in plants.

Transgenic overexpression of wild-type, but not an unphosphorylatable mutant ARR2, led to delayed senescence of leaves.
Results show that cytokinins modulate salicylic acid signaling to augment resistance against Pst, a process in which the interaction between NPR1/TGA3 and ARR2 is important.
Cytokinin facilitates the degradation of ARR2 protein.
Cytokinin-facilitated degradation of ARR2 must be appreciated as a post-translational event important for regulating cytokinin signaling intensity.
Data indicate that one of the immediate early cytokinin response genes is ARR6, which has been shown to be a direct target gene of ARR1, ARR2 and other type-B ARRs.
Data suggest that shoot removal induces the quantitative and qualitative development of chloroplasts in roots, with cytokinin signaling via RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-ARR1 and ARR12 functioning downstream of wounding signaling to up-regulate genes associated with chloroplast development.
ARR2 directly activates the expression of PRX33 and PRX34, which are required for SA- and PAMP-triggered ROS production. Thus, the CK signaling pathway regulates ROS homeostasis in guard cells, which leads to enhanced stomatal immunity and plant resistance to bacteria.

ERF6, a substrate of MPK3 and MPK6, plays important roles downstream of the MPK3/MPK6 cascade in regulating plant defense against fungal pathogens.
ERF5 and ERF6 form a missing link between the previously observed stress-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid accumulation and DELLA-mediated cell cycle exit and execute a dual role by regulating both stress tolerance and growth inhibition.
Results indicate that ERF6 plays an important role as a positive antioxidant regulator during plant growth and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.

structure of pyrabactin resistance 1 (PYR1); structure reveals an alpha/beta helix-grip fold & homodimeric assembly; abscisic acid (ABA) binding within a large internal cavity switches structural motifs distinguishing ABA-free from ABA-bound conformations

study suggests both nuclear and cytoplasmic PYR1 participate in the control of ABA signal transduction
Data indicate that bscisic acid (ABA) signaling is repressed by group A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), and then ABA binds to its receptor of the ACTIN RESISTANCE1 (PYR1), PYR1-LIKE (PYL), and REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (RCAR) family, which, in turn, inhibits PP2Cs and activates downstream ABA signaling.

In mutants the number of starch granules per plastid dramatically decreased leading to a large increase in their size.
The data point to a complex mechanism for starch granule formation and to the different abilities of SSIV and SSIII to support this process in Arabidopsis leaves.
Overexpression of SSIV induces the accumulation of starch in Arabidopsis.
SS4 is an essential component of a mechanism that coordinates granule formation with chloroplast division during leaf expansion.
SS4 forms dimers, which depends on a region located between the coiled-coil region and the glycosyltransferase domain of SS4. This region is highly conserved between all SS4 enzymes sequenced to date. We show that the dimerization seems to be necessary for the activity of the enzyme.
SS4 plays a key role in granule initiation, allowing it to proceed in a way that avoids premature degradation of primers by starch hydrolases, such as AMY3.
Results indicate that plastidal phosphorylase (PHS1) and starch synthase 4 (SS4) are differently involved in starch granule formation and do not act in series.
the N-terminal part of SS4 serves to establish the correct granule morphology by properly localizing this activity.

BIN2 phosphorylates HAT1 and probably stabilizes HAT1.
Results suggest that AtSK12 mediates brassinosteroid-regulated cell growth but not stomatal development while BIN2 regulates both processes.
phosphorylation of ARF7 and ARF19 by BRASSINOSTEROID-insensitive2 (BIN2) can also potentiate auxin signalling output during lateral root organogenesis.

Interaction between the PINOID/ABRUPTUS gene with the AGAMOUS gene: the negative regulator of stem cells in the meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana flower
AGAMOUS directly represses WUS expression by binding to the WUS locus and recruiting, directly or indirectly, PcG that methylates histone H3 Lys-27 at WUS.
in the delicately balanced regulatory network, NSN1 acts to repress AG and plays an additive role with AP2 in floral organ specification.
Data indicate that C function regulator AGAMOUS and the B function regulators APETALA3 and PISTILLATA control many developmental processes in conjunction, as well as independent activities.
In the floral meristem, the binding of AG to WUS is reduced in top1a-2, which results in reduced H3K27me3 levels at WUS and prolonged WUS expression, and consequently loss of floral determinacy.
ARF3 integrates the functions of AGAMOUS and APETALA2 in floral meristem determinacy.
The ULT1 and LFY pathways act separately in regulating identity and determinacy at the floral meristem. In particular, they independently induce AG expression in the centre of the flower to terminate meristem activity.
FLK and PEP physically interact with proteins involved in AG pre-mRNA processing to secure correct AG function in the floral meristem and flower
AP2 does not repress the transcription of AG in the inner two whorls, but instead counteracts AG activity.

Amino acid composition of BAM1 and BAM3 orthologs reflected differences that are consistent with known adaptations of proteins from heat- and cold-adapted organisms, suggesting that the day- and night-active enzymes have undergone thermal adaptation.

The A-domain is not simply degraded but it accumulates as a soluble, phosphorylated protein separated from Toc159.
The A-domains of the Toc159 family members are major determinants of distinct pathways for protein import into plastids.
The Toc159 A-domain participates in preprotein selectivity, has typical features of intrinsically unfolded proteins, is highly phosphorylated and possibly released from the rest of the protein by a proteolytic event.

we find that BSK3 upregulates BSU1 transcript and protein levels to activate BR signaling. BSK3 is broadly expressed and plays an important role in BR-mediated root growth, shoot growth, and organ separation. Together, our findings suggest that BSK3 may function as a scaffold protein to regulate BR signaling. The results of our studies provide new insights into early BR signaling mechanisms.

The suppression of late flowering is caused by the inability of FRIgida to increase late flowering.
The contribution to variation in flowering time and vernalization of the two genes FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), previously shown to be important determinants in natural variation of flowering time is reported.
Epistasis analysis between FES1, FRI and FRIGIDA-LIKE 1 (FRL1), indicates that these genes do not function in a linear pathway, but instead act cooperatively to promote the expression of FLC.
FRI upregulates FLC expression that represses flowering
These antagonistic pleiotropic effects reduce the adaptive value of FRI, and helps explain the maintenance of alternative life history strategies across natural populations of A. thaliana.
The role of FLX in the timing of flowers and the expression of other flowering-related proteins, including FRIGIDA and FLC, is reported.
Natural allelic variation in FRI can mediate response to selection for early flowering.

FRI and FRL1 contain a stable, central domain that is conserved across the FRI superfamily.
FRI forms a large protein complex which interacts with FLC-specific regulators and recruits cromatin modification factors.

ABP1 is a key regulator for root growth and is required for auxin-mediated responses
AtRma2 is likely involved in the cellular regulation of ABP1 expression levels.
Study demonstrates that ABP1 mediates a nontranscriptional auxin signaling that regulates process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and suggests that this signaling may be essential for the developmentally important feedback of auxin on its own transport.
The heterozygous abp1/ABP1 insertion mutant has defects in auxin physiology-related responses: higher root slanting angles, longer hypocotyls, agravitropic roots and hypocotyls, aphototropic hypocotyls, and decreased apical dominance.

Phenotypes linked to auxin transport were compromised in three complemented abp1 mutants. Red light effects were all compromised in the complemented lines. Auxin-induced expression was delayed after 10 min, and light-induced expression within 60 min.
a phyB null allele in the abp1-5 background is likely causative for the long hypocotyl phenotype previously attributed to disrupted ABP1 function.
ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.
The molecular structural differences of ABP1 found between the species and auxin types indicate that this auxin-binding protein shows functional specificities in dicots and monocots, as well as in auxin type binding.

Upon seed imbibition, increased Gibberellin (GA)levels reduce DELLA protein abundance and release ATML1/PDF2 to activate L1 box gene expression, thus enhancing germination potential.

the exon 8 domain of PTOX (IMMUTANS) is required for PTOX activity and stability in Arabidopsis
IMMUTANS appears to be a versatile electron sink, especially early in chloroplast development, when its function is crucial for carotenoid biosynthesis, and in excess light, when it serves as a 'safety valve'.
Neither functional analyses of the immutans (IM) knockout and overexpression lines nor meta-analyses of gene expression support the model that IM acts as a safety valve to regulate the redox state of the PQ pool during stress and acclimation
Plants lacking IM have enhanced rates of carbon assimilation with corresponding increases in the activities of Rubisco and SPS, elevated starch and sucrose pool sizes, and an altered pattern of carbohydrate partitioning that favors sucrose over starch.
Lack of colored carotenoids in the im white tissues elicits a differential response from a large number of genes involved in various cellular processes and stress responses.

identification of 83 new point mutations in BRI1, including nine mutations that exhibit an allelic series of typical bri1 phenotypes, from subtle to severe morphological alterations, is reported.
The ability of the kinase domain of BRI1 to generate cGMP depends on its kinase catalytic ability. Furthermore, cGMP stimulates phosphorylation of BSK1. Therefore, cGMP is proposed to act as a modulator to stimulate activation of downstream phosphorylation of members of the BRI1 signaling pathway.

Demethylation by DEMETER is necessary for genomic imprinting and defines the genomic methylation profile of Arabidopsis genes.
Gene ontology analysis identified three molecular functions enriched in the DME-inducible RNA list: DNA or RNA binding, kinase activity, and transcription factor activity.
Analyses indicate that AtLIG1 acts downstream of DME. The removal of methylated cytosine residues by DME involves the creation of DNA single-strand breaks and our results suggest that AtLIG1 repairs these breaks.

Data test that hypothesis using Arabidopsis plants expressing the cellulose synthase GFP-CESA3 and show that cellulose synthase trajectories do rotate over several hours.
CESA1(A903V) and CESA3(T942I) have modified microfibril structure in terms of crystallinity and suggest that in plants, as in bacteria, crystallization biophysically limits polymerization.
The cell walls in the roots of these four AtCESA3 alleles contain different percentages of cellulose, and these percentages correlate with the lengths of the roots and cortex cells in these roots when grown on media containing high levels of sucrose.
computational findings on transmembrane helices (TMHs) 5 and 6 in three CESAs of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCESA1, 3, and 6), the Atcesa3(ixr1-2) mutant, and a novel missense mutation in AtCESA1, are reported.

Altogether these data demonstrate that HsfA3 is transcriptionally controlled by DREB2A and important for the establishment of thermotolerance.
These results indicate that HsfA3 regulates expression of many heat-inducible genes in the transcriptional cascade downstream of the DREB2A stress-regulatory system and functions in acquisition of thermotolerance under the control of the DREB2A cascade.
Overexpression of DREB1A improves stress tolerance to both freezing and dehydration while overexpression of an active form of DREB2A results in significant stress tolerance to dehydration but only slight tolerance to freezing.
These results suggest that in addition to an abscissic acid (ABA)-independent pathway, the ABA-dependent pathway plays a positive role in the osmotic stress-responsive expression of DREB2A.
In addition RCD1 is rapidly degraded during heat stress, thus our results suggest that removal of RCD1 protein or the loss of the interaction domain in DREB2A appears to be required for proper DREB2A function under stress conditions.
Functional interactions between Dreb2a and Med25 induce conformational changes which in turn cause changes in their binding affinity.

Data show that CRN, rather than CLV1 and CLV2, was able to form homodimers without CLV3 stimulation.
This study suggested that the CLV3 signal is perceived by a tetrameric CLV2/CRN complex and a CLV1 homodimer that localize to the PM and can interact via CRN.
The results therefore imply that the CLE14/CLE20 peptides may act through the CLV2-CRN receptor kinase, and that their availabilities and/or abundances may be affected by cytokinin activity in planta.
A 12-mer random-peptide library was used to determine the specific amino acid sequences binding with the recombinant CRN molecule.
CRN contains features of a pseudokinase but lacks kinase activity
Our results suggest a model in which CLV1/BAM1 and CLV2/CRN complexes act in separate, parallel pathways in shoot meristems, while the CLV1, CLV2, and CRN receptors function together in a linear pathway during fruit development.

KEG is central to abscisic acid signaling by maintaining low levels of ABI5 in the absence of stress.
Loss-of-function mutations in KEG are seedling lethal and are hypersensitive to glucose and abscisic acid
Overexpression of KEG renders plant insensitive to abscisic acid and salt. Abscisic acid promotes KEG degradation via the ubiquitin-dependent 26S proteasome pathway.

AtDCP2 is essential for post-embryonic development and supplies new insights into the role of decapping-dependent mRNA turnover.
Mutational analysis of the putative RNA-binding domain of Dcp2 confirmed the functional significance of an 11-residue loop region and the conserved Box B.
DCP5 associates with DCP1 and DCP2 and is required for mRNA decapping in vivo. In spite of its association with DCP2, DCP5 has no effect on DCP2 decapping activity in vitro, suggesting that the effect on decapping in vivo is indirect.
Seedling lethal phenotypes in dcp1, dcp2 and vcs mutants are caused the disruption of miRNA-mediated gene regulation.
A mutation in AtDCP2 (At5g13570) caused the co-suppression phenotype in the its1 mutant, which displayed increased transgene silencing.

PDAT1 and DGAT1 have overlapping functions for triacylglycerol synthesis in both seed and pollen, and that the absence of their function leads not only to a reduction in TAG, but also to critical defects in normal pollen and embryo development. 
Triacylglycerol synthesis by PDAT1 in the absence of DGAT1 activity is dependent on re-acylation of LPC by LPCAT2.
PDAT1 plays a critical role in mediating triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and thereby protecting against free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced cell death in fast-growing tissues of plants.
Data show that PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) and SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 (SDP1) TAG lipase, function synergistically in directing fatty acids (FAs) toward peroxisomal beta-oxidation via triacylglycerol (TAG) intermediates.
PDAT, transferring a fatty acyl moiety from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to diacylglycerol (DAG), was shown to be essential for heat-induced TAG accumulation. Finally, we show that pdat1mutant lines unable to accumulate TAGs under heat-stress conditions display normal short-term acquired thermotolerance but are compromised in basal thermotolerance.

AtSPX1 and AtSPX3 play positive roles in plant adaptation to phosphate starvation, and AtSPX3 may have a negative feedback regulatory role in AtSPX1 response to phosphate starvation.
The relative strength of the SPX1/PHR1 interaction is thus directly influenced by phosphate (Pi), providing a link between Pi perception and signaling.
These data suggest that, in the Pi-restored condition, AtSPX1 can bind to monomeric AtPHR1 in solution and therefore regulate PSI gene expression by tuning the AtPHR1-DNA-binding equilibrium.

DCL4 and DCL2 exhibit specific, hierarchical antiviral activities; inhibition of DCL4 by a viral-encoded suppressor revealed the subordinate antiviral activity of DCL2
DCL4 is the primary producer of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) derived siRNAs and also produces turnip crinkle virus (TCV)-derived siRNAs. DCL2 appears to be the major producer of TCV-derived siRNAs, likely because TCV suppresses the activity of DCL4.
Several gene transcripts were found to be routed through the RDR6/DCL4-dependent pathway after initial targeting by one or multiple microRNAs or trans-acting short interfering RNA.
Study shows that unidirectional (3-->5') transitivity requires the hierarchical and redundant functions of DCL4 and DCL2 acting downstream from RDR6 to produce 21- and 22-nt-long siRNAs, respectively.
DCL4 is capable of accessing flexibly structured single-stranded RNA substrates (preferably T-shaped hairpins) to produce satsiRNAs. This result reveals that viral RNA of diverse structures may stimulate antiviral DCL activities in plant cells.

ARF7 plays a major role in regulating expression of a subset of auxin response genes in leaf mesophyll cells.
Mutations in ARF19 have little effect on their own, but in combination with mutations in NPH4/ARF7, encoding the most closely related ARF, they cause several phenotypes.
ARF7 acts to regulate the auxin-mediated transcription of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE18 (LBD16/ASL18) and/or LBD29/ASL16 in roots.
Reduced upregulation of glycolipid synthase and phospholipase genes in these mutants under Pi-deficient conditions indicates that IAA14 and ARF7/19 affect membrane lipid remodeling at the level of transcription.

AtBRCA2 is required for proper meiotic synapsis and mediates the recruitment of AtRAD51 and AtDMC1.
Establishment and stabilisation of pairing of homologous centromeric and pericentromeric regions depends principally upon DMC1, while pairing and synapsis of euchromatic chromosome arms of homologues requires the presence of RAD51

The present study demonstrates for the first time the involvement of a host RAD51 protein in mungbean yellow mosaic India virus replication.
Our data demonstrate that RAD51 plays a supporting role for DMC1 in meiotic recombination in the flowering plant, Arabidopsis.

RAD51 forms a protein complex with AtRAD51C-AtXRCC3 to facilitate RAD51 localization on chromosomes for meiotic recombination.
Although the presence of RAD51 protein provides essential support for the action of DMC1, these results show no significant effect of the absence of RAD51 strand-exchange activity on meiotic crossing-over rates or patterns in different chromosomal regions or across the whole genome of Arabidopsis, strongly supporting the argument that DMC1 catalyses repair of all meiotic DNA breaks, not only non-sister cross-overs.
